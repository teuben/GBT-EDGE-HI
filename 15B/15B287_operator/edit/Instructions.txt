Instructions for project GBT15B-287 - OPERATOR RUN MODE

- QUICK REFERENCE

1. Submit 15B287_operator in Astrid
2. Check the first AutoPeakFocus looks ok
3. Check VEGAS gets selected and balances 3 banks reasonably.
4. At the end of the time hit 'Stop' (or 'Abort', but only if you must).
5. Export the log to /home/astro-util/projects/GBT15B_operator/logs/

*** If the scheduling block ends by itself (check on it every now and then),
    follow the instructions in the last section of the detailed instructions
    below.


---------------------- DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS --------------------------

- Starting the Observation

1. Select the 'Run' tab in astrid
2. Choose AGBT15B_287 under 'Project'. (-> AGBT -> AGBT15B - AGBT15B_287)
3. Allow astrid to automatically increase the session number.
4. Enter appropriate values for the 'Observer' and 'Operator'.
5. Select the observing script '15B287_operator' from the list of available
   scheduling blocks.
6. Click 'Submit'.


- Monitor 1st Peak/Focus

1. The script will perform an AutoPeakFocus at the start of the experiment.
2. Select the 'DataDisplay' tab in Astrid.
3. Select the 'Pointing' sub-tab directly under 'DataDisplay'.
3. 4 peak scans should appear sequentially in the window.  All four should
   show a peak centered around zero.
   Example: /home/astro-util/projects/15B287_operator/pointing.jpeg
4. 1 focus scan will then be performed.
   Example: /home/astro-util/projects/15B287_operator/focus.jpeg

  - PLEASE NOTE: the script may decide to perform an additional AutoPeak
    after the above AutoPeakFocus.  Just let it run, you should not need to
    check anything if the first peaks were ok.


- VEGAS Observations

2. The system will reconfigure to use VEGAS.
3. In cleo select the VEGAS screen.
4. 3 banks of VEGAS should be selected (highlighted green box under
   'SubSysSelect' column).
5. VEGAS will balance.  Check values of selected banks are around -20 in the
   'Power' column.
6. Start an internet browser and go to https://vegasdisplay-beta.gb.nrao.edu/
7. Once the first scans start, the default screen should show 3 plots.  See
   the example /home/astro-util/projects/15B287_operator/vegas_data_display.jpeg

  - PLEASE NOTE: The data display appears to be very buggy.  It has only
    worked for me a few times.  If the screen is blank, but scans are
    running with VEGAS selected, just let the observing script continue.


- At the end of the session.

1. Hit 'Stop' in Astrid (or 'Abort' if 'Stop' is greyed out)
2. Go to the 'ObservationManagement' tab of Astrid and then click 'Export Log'
   at the bottom of the screen.
3. Save the log as
   /home/astro-util/projects/GBT15B_operator/logs/DDMonYYYY_hhmm.txt
   Please change DDMonYYYY_hhmm to real date-times values.  Naming
   examples can be found in that directory.  If unsure, just name it
   whatever and someone will change it later.  You don't need to be
   exact with the hours and minutes.


- EXCEPTIONS AND ERRORS:

The script should not fail, but it is conceivable that it could end without
performing any scans.  This is because it selects sources based on LST 
ranges and the start time of the submitted script.  If nothing is observered,
then there are no sources left to observe in that LST range. If this happens:

 - Resubmit the script

       OR (if that fails)

 - Run the alternate script: 15B287_operator_backup

The backup script will search through all available sources for the project
and attempt to find one that is observable.  If the script continues to
start/immediately stop (without an error message) then there is nothing else
you can do since the project has been scheduled at a bad time.  The best you
could do is resubmit the script in 10-15 minutes intervals in the
hope that an observable source will have risen above the horizon.

In the case of an error leading to abort: Call Dan Perera or the on-call
support scientist if I'm unavailable.
