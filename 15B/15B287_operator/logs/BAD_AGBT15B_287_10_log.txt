######### NOTES ###############
# This script runs in blocks of On-Off-On position switching with
# the two outer 'on' scans sharing one 'off'
# Total on-source time = 42 minutes   (24 if changes)
# Length of one 'On' or 'Off' = 7 minutes   (4 minutes if changes)
# Length of one On-Off-On = 21 minutes (14 minutes on-source)    (12 min if changes)
# 3 On-Off-On blocks are needed per source (63 minutes altogether)  (36 minutes if changes)
# !!!! Please remember to update catalog after session is complete

###### Timing
# It takes 1h 8m to completely observe 1 source+overhead (9 track scans)
