######### NOTES ###############
# This script runs in blocks of On-Off-On position switching with
# the two outer 'on' scans sharing one 'off'
# Total on-source time = 20 minutes
# Length of one 'On' or 'Off' = 3 minutes 20 seconds
# Length of one On-Off-On = 10 minutes
# 3 On-Off-On blocks are needed per source (30 minutes total per source)

###### Timing
# It takes 34m to completely observe 1 source+overhead (9 track scans)
