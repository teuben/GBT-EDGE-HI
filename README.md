# GBT-EDGE-HI

HI survey of EDGE galaxies.   Started with **AGBT15B_287**, where 100+ galaxies were
observed in a modified PositionSwitch using ON-OFF-ON and a corresponding getsigref
procedure. The original GBTIDL procedure can be done with `edge.pro`.

The followup project code is **AGBT25A_474**.

Old observing scripts at GBO:

  * /home/astro-util/projects/15B287_operator
  * /home/astro-util/projects/15B287

these have been recorded in our `15B` directory.  An example to reduce these for NGC 2805
are in the `examples/` directory

## Installation

Install [dysh](https://github.com/GreenBankObservatory/dysh) in your choice of a (virtual) environment.

There is an example `install_dysh` script for this as well.

If you want the dysh profile (see test1.py),

```
   ipython profile create dysh
   cp 90-dysh.py ~/.ipython/profile_dysh/startup/
```

after which

```
   ipython --profile=dysh
```

will start the poor-man's version of dysh. See comments in `test1.py`

Normally the command

```
   dysh
```

will get you an interactive session.


## Example

Make sure your data is in the `$SDFITS_DATA` directory (or use /home/sdfits).
If you use $DYSH_DATA, they
can also be located in the `$DYSH_DATA/sdfits` directory



```
f1=dysh_data('AGBT15B_287_19')
sdf1 = GBTFITSLoad(f1)
sdf1.filename
```

but for now the following
is a bug/feature (see https://github.com/GreenBankObservatory/dysh/issues/740)

```
unset DYSH_DATA
export SDFITS_DATA=/home/teuben/GBT/dysh_data/sdfits
dysh
  f2=dysh_data('AGBT15B_287_19')
  sdf2=GBTOffline('AGBT15B_287_19')
  sdf2.filename

  f1=dysh_data('AGBT15B_287_19', dysh_data='/home/teuben/GBT/dysh_data/')

```
